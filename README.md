<a name="Summary"/>
<h4>Summary</h4>
====================

This repository houses two Python scripts that allow the user to easily plot results from the output of BASE-9/BASE-N single or mutliple population Bayesian analysis. The BASE-9 package uses Bayesian analysis techniques to determine a best fit isochrone to a cluster of stellar photometry from a set of selected theoretical models.

Each Python script contains a function written to plot all of the iterations of the adaptive Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration of parameter space for a cluster run with BASE-9's output format.

<a name="Deps"/>
<h4>Dependencies</h4>
====================

This Python code was written using Python 2.6 and Numpy 1.5.1, but should be compatible with many other versions (though not Python 3.0 or higher). The user may have to install the matplotlib, gridspec, and pylab packages.
